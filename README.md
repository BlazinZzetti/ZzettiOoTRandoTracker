# ZzettiOoTRandoTracker
So far just a stream side item tracker that's pretty ugly imo.

Plans for this tool:
* Map tracker view.
  * To keep better track of where you have been and what exactly you can still collect.
  * Include Skulltulla and Sheikah Stone locations if needed.
* Android compatable build.
  * So I dont have to use my laptop when playing offline on my TV.
  * Would also help those who dont have much screen space during a stream.
* Windows build with touch screen support
  * Pretty much the main reason I dont like using my laptop. Trying to use a mouse or the touchpad sucks sometimes.
* Networkable so two clients can talk to each other
  * This would be useful not just for having the map and the item view open, but also co-op runs where players can easily share information.
* Maybe some suggestion logic?
  * Help me think the way I would and push those checks to the top?
